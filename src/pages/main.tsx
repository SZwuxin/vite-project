      <h2>My name is Siteng and this is my personal website built using vite, react and run using bun</h2>
      <p> Code for this website is located in this <a target='_blank'
            rel='noopener noreferrer' href="https://github.com/SZwuxin/vite-project">github link</a></p>
      <h2> Introduction and Motivation: </h2>
      <p> My name is Siteng, and I've created a personal website using Vite, React, and Bun. I embarked on this project as a way to 
        stay productive and practice my React skills after rejecting a downleveled job offer. 
        Feeling a bit disheartened, I decided to channel my energy into building something new.</p>
      
      <h2> Design Approach and Challenges: </h2>
      <p> I've always wanted to build a website from scratch, not using any template or things just my own ideas and thoughts. Admittedly, my artistic abilities are limited, 
        and I do not consider myself a designer. Therefore, I've made an exception for some pages by allowing Bootstrap. The main landing page, though, 
        remains my exclusive creation, regardless of its quality. However, considering my artistic ability, I am taking a page out of <a target='_blank'
            rel='noopener noreferrer' href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/">this website</a> to keep it lightweight and simple.</p>
      <h2>Website Vision and Pages:</h2>
      <p>My website aims to be an accumulation of everything I want to create. It will feature six main pages accessible via the navigation bar: </p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Stories page contains things I wish to write about.</li>
        <li>Articles page contains outside articles I find interesting. </li>
        <li>Games page contains games initially written in python and later adapted to React.</li>
        <li>Tools page contains useful tools, similar to games page.</li>
        <li>Main page, the one you are reading right now. </li>
        <li>Timeline page where I hope to maintain a diary-like record</li>
      </ul>
      <p>   While I can't promise daily updates, I will complete the site. </p>      
    </>
