          <h2>On optimism</h2>
          <p>I have been reading Zero to One by Peter Thiel recently, and its discussion of pessimism and optimism has truly inspired me. Now that I reflect on it, being a pessimist is easy. </p>
          <p>Pessimists have a convenient way out for every problem they encounter in life: they simply blame the future and say, "I told you things would get worse."" Any hardship they face becomes expected, and any failure is easily explained away. Pessimism stifles invention and hard work because why put in effort or invent new things if it will all be in vain later on?</p>
          <p>On the other hand, optimists have something to strive for. Knowing that the future holds promise motivates people to experience it fully. They are willing to sacrifice the present for greater returns down the line. Optimism encourages long-term thinking and investment, all in pursuit of the better future they envision with clarity."</p>

          <p>I like to think of myself as an eternal optimist, probably due to my own experience. For the past fifteen years, I witnessed how our family situation improved every single year, and I am thrilled to work toward the better future I believe in. </p>
